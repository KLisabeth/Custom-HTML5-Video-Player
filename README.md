> Studying this project we learned about:

* Using `querySelector` to access our classes inside of a parent < div >.
* About video property `paused`.
* Accessing `dataset` and wrapping it into `parceFloat` function to convert it into a true number.
* How to loop through every single checkbox with `forEach` method.
* How to update `flex-basis` value in `progress_field` with a function calculating percentage. 
* How to make 'mousedown' listen to an event if 'mousedown' is true will fire a scrub if it's false will do nothing.
* How to make full screen to open by calling `requestFullScreen` method that requires specific prefixes to work in different browsers
* How to make full screen close by `exitFullscreen` method that requires specific prefixes to work in different browsers
